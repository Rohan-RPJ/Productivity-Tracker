4. To calculate similarity between two texts: To take the input speech from user,
   convert it to text and match that given text(question) to the given list of questions and
   answer that question.The text similarity calculation is done by using Cosine Similarity Algorithms.
{
	a. {
			Link:https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-string-similarity-in-python-276e18a7d33a
			Use the above link to refer for calculating string similarity in python
	}

	b.{
	    Create two separate files to store list of questions and answers
	    Lastly use text to speech to convert that answer into speech and answer the user
	    In required cases, also show the UI to the user simultaneously.
	}
}


problems to be solved=>{

	b. To perform 4.b
	c. Questions contains variables like app_name which will be stored in run time in json file. Hence need to find a way 
	   to extract the app name the user is speaking.
	d. Answers too are stored which contains variables like time_spent, title, app_name. Hance need to find a way
	   while answering such questions to the user.
	e. To convert long links to short links using python
		{
			Links:{
				1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/url-shorteners-and-its-api-in-python-set-1/
				2: https://realpython.com/lessons/url-shortener/
			}
		}
	f. Use voice of Jarvis used in Iron Man.
}

problems solved=>{
	a. Speech to text 
	b. Text to speech
	c. To use hostname or website name(recommended) of website instead of link as a key in json and instead store the link inside hostname as a value.
	d. To perform 4.a
